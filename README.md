# Welcome to your new MonAmi Your Cognitive Companion Hackathon Video - https://optum.video.uhc.com/media/OSR_MonAmi_Global_Hackathon_OSR/1_6ga2oxbo


We have utilized the power of Azure Bot Composer incorporating the Virtual Assistant capabilities directly into the Composer.
 
Added Natural Language Understanding Capabilities using Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) - cloud-based conversational AI Cognitive Service with custom machine-learning intelligence to MonAmi's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information for context like name, age, hobbies, emotions, activities, feelings, etc. Followd by QnA/FAQ type Capabilities using QnA Maker which is cloud-based Cognitive API service, integrated and built a custom knowledge base extracting questions & answers from semi-structured content, majorly for the Motivational Videos. The knowledge base gets smarter, too, as it continually learns from user behavior!
 
It has been extensively trained using Natural Language Understanding models directly in the context of editing a dialog - basis user's responses with Natural Language Generation to create bot replies with a great deal of flexibility for grammatically correct, data-driven responses that have a consistent tone for evolved Cognitive Behavioral Therapy over the agreed upon sessions while we have utlized the GraphQL APIs via Hasura Cloud for the session and data tracking for the defined period.
 
Tested via Bot Framework Emulator and can be published to Azure App Service and App Functions basis the subscriptions.
